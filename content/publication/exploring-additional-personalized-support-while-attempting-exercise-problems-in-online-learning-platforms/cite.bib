abstract = {In online asynchronous learning environments, students are assigned exercises, but
it is not clear how to incorporate the kinds of actions an in-person tutor might take
such as explaining, providing more practice, prompting for reflection, and motivating.
We explore approaches to adding "Drop-Downs'' that appear after a student submits
an answer and that contain additional information to support learning. We conducted
randomized A/B experiments exploring the impact of these Drop-Downs on student learning
in the online portion of a flipped CS1 course. The deployed Drop-Downs in this course
provided explanations, reflective prompts, additional problems, and motivational messages.
The results suggest that students benefit from various Drop-Downs in different contexts,
indicating the possibility of personalizing content based on the student's state.
We discuss the resulting design implications of Drop-Downs in online learning systems.},
