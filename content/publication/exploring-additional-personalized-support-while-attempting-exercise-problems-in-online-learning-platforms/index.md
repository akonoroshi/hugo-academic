abstract: In online asynchronous learning environments, students are assigned
  exercises, but it is not clear how to incorporate the kinds of actions an
  in-person tutor might take such as explaining, providing more practice,
  prompting for reflection, and motivating. We explore approaches to adding
  "Drop-Downs'' that appear after a student submits an answer and that contain
  additional information to support learning. We conducted randomized A/B
  experiments exploring the impact of these Drop-Downs on student learning in
  the online portion of a flipped CS1 course. The deployed Drop-Downs in this
  course provided explanations, reflective prompts, additional problems, and
  motivational messages. The results suggest that students benefit from various
  Drop-Downs in different contexts, indicating the possibility of personalizing
  content based on the student's state. We discuss the resulting design
  implications of Drop-Downs in online learning systems.
