abstract: There is evidence from cognitive psychology and education about the
  benefits of prompting people to explain the meaning of what they are learning
  in their own words (Williams & Lombrozo, 2013; 2010), such as why an answer
  they chose is correct. These findings have promising applications in learning
  environments, but surprisingly little research explores how to effectively
  motivate people to engage in reflection to enhance their learning in a
  real-world online educational setting. In this paper, we investigate how to
  motivate novice programming students to engage in prompts to explain in an
  online homework platform. To encourage writing explanations, we tell some
  students that their instructor will read their explanation submissions. We
  find that these students perform better on subsequent problems. Interestingly,
  this happens despite evidence that being told their instructor would read
  their explanations seemed to have no effect on how many people wrote
  explanations, or may even have reduced how many students actually wrote
  explanations (qualitative data suggests some students may not have felt
  confident enough to submit an explanation for their instructor to read). Our
  work highlights the complexities of implementing reflective exercises in a
  digital learning environment.
