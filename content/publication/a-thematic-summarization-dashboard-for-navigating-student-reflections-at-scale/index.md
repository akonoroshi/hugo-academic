abstract: Instructors often ask students to reflect on projects or tasks because
  it has been shown to be effective for learning. Instructors also use these
  reflections to improve future offerings of a course. Sifting through
  reflections manually, however, is both time-consuming and inefficient,
  especially for large courses. This paper describes a method for organizing
  student reflections by named entities (i.e., topics of interest) and
  instructor-defined “themes” to produce summaries that better meet the needs of
  instructors. Named entities are first extracted from the reflection corpus.
  Upon choosing one named entity to explore, sentences mentioning that entity
  are collated from across student reflections. The selected sentences are then
  classified into instructor-defined themes. Instructors can choose to re-define
  themes as necessary with support from the system in the form of prevalence
  statistics and theme-definition suggestions. Finally, a summary of student
  reflections for each theme is provided. This process and the resulting
  summaries were evaluated in a semi-structured Wizard of Oz interview study
  with the teaching assistants of a 160-student graduate-level course on Cloud
  Computing offered online to the students at Carnegie Mellon University.
  Results from quantitative Likert-scale analyses and qualitative coding show
  that teaching assistants preferred our topic and theme-focused summaries over
  general summaries generated from a random subset of student reflections.
  Deployment in the form of an instructor-facing dashboard and improvement to
  the system to allow for uncommonly expressed content to be better discoverable
  through the dashboard are planned for future work.
