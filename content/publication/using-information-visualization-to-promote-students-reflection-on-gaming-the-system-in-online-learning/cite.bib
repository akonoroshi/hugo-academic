abstract = {"Gaming the system" is the phenomenon where students attempt to perform well by systematically
exploiting properties of the learning system, rather than learning the material. Frequent
gaming tends to cause bad learning outcomes. Though existing studies tackle the problem
by redesigning the system workflow to change students' behaviors automatically, gaming
students discover new ways to game. We instead propose a novel way, reflective nudge,
to reflectively influence students' attitudes by conveying reasons not to game via
information visualizations. Particularly, we identify three common gaming contexts
and involve students and instructors in co-designing three context-specific persuasive
visualizations. We deploy our information visualizations in a real online learning
platform. Through embedded surveys and in-person interviews, we find some evidence
that the designs can promote students' reflection on gaming, and suggestive data that
two of them can reduce gaming compared with control groups. Furthermore, we present
insights into reflective nudge designs and practical issues concerning deployment.},
