abstract: "\"Gaming the system\" is the phenomenon where students attempt to
  perform well by systematically exploiting properties of the learning system,
  rather than learning the material. Frequent gaming tends to cause bad learning
  outcomes. Though existing studies tackle the problem by redesigning the system
  workflow to change students' behaviors automatically, gaming students discover
  new ways to game. We instead propose a novel way, reflective nudge, to
  reflectively influence students' attitudes by conveying reasons not to game
  via information visualizations. Particularly, we identify three common gaming
  contexts and involve students and instructors in co-designing three
  context-specific persuasive visualizations. We deploy our information
  visualizations in a real online learning platform. Through embedded surveys
  and in-person interviews, we find some evidence that the designs can promote
  students' reflection on gaming, and suggestive data that two of them can
  reduce gaming compared with control groups. Furthermore, we present insights
  into reflective nudge designs and practical issues concerning deployment."
