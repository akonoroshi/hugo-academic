abstract = {In the context of online programming homework for a university course, we explore
the extent to which learners engage with optional prompts to self -explain answers
they choose for problems. Such prompts are known to benefit learning in laboratory
and classroom settings [4], but there are less data about the extent to which students
engage with them when they are optional additions to online homework. We report data
from a deployment of self-explanation prompts in online programming homework, providing
insight into how the frequency of writing explanations is correlated with different
variables, such as how early students start homework, whether they got a problem correct,
and how proficient they are in the language of instruction. We also report suggestive
results from a randomized experiment comparing several methods for increasing the
rate at which people write explanations, such as including more than one kind of prompt.
These findings provide insight into promising dimensions to explore in understanding
how real students may engage with prompts to explain answers.},
