Yuya Asano is a Ph.D. student in [Intelligent Systems](http://www.isp.pitt.edu/) at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/), supervised by [Professor Diane Litman](http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~litman/). His research interest lies in the intersection of natural language processing (NLP), human-computer interaction (HCI), and educational technology. He works on the application of NLP in the domain of education to make distance learning more interactive and offer rich education to everyone regardless of their socioeconomic status. 

He received HBSc in [Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), Canada, where he worked with [Professor Joseph Jay Williams](http://www.josephjaywilliams.com) on applying reinforcement learning to educational interventions. He also collaborated with [Professor Carolyn Penstein Rose](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/) and [Professor Majd Sakr](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~msakr/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) on the generation of instructionally beneficial programming hints for students and the thematic summarization of students' in-course reflections.
